# Healthcare Inequality in NHS Hospital Admissions & Dementia Care Insights

## Overview
This repository contains two comprehensive Tableau dashboards developed as part of my MSc Business Analytics capstone module. These projects analyze critical healthcare challenges within the NHS in England, focusing on inequality in hospital admissions and dementia care service gaps. Advanced data cleaning, integration, and visualization techniques reveal important patterns to support evidence-based decision-making by NHS stakeholders.

## Project 1: Inequality in Hospital Admissions

- Developed a public-facing Tableau dashboard analyzing 8 NHS datasets using Python and Excel for data integration.
- Identified regional variations, gender and age disparities, diagnosis-level demand, and population-adjusted inequality metrics.
- Created key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Admission Rate per 100,000, Gender Disparity Index, and Average Wait Time by Diagnosis.
- Designed for broad public accessibility to raise awareness about healthcare inequities through impactful data storytelling.

## Project 2: Dementia Care Insights â€“ Regional Trends and Service Gaps

- Built an internal Tableau dashboard to aid NHS leadership in strategic and operational planning.
- Standardized and integrated 13+ raw NHS datasets including dementia prevalence data using Python and Excel.
- Delivered core metrics including Diagnosis Coverage Rate, Antipsychotic Prescribing Ratio, and Comorbidity Index by region.
- Provided actionable insights on care pathway engagement, prescribing compliance, and risk monitoring to facilitate regional benchmarking.

## Data Handling and Preparation

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and addressed missing values to ensure consistency.
- Standardized date formats, categorical fields, and healthcare metric definitions.

### Data Structuring
- Harmonized multiple datasets with consistent identifiers and measures.
- Calculated composite KPIs and normalized rates per population for fair comparisons.

## Dashboard Development in Tableau

### Visual Design
- Created interactive visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, trend lines, and geographic maps to display inequality and care trends.
- Designed clear layouts to support both public users and NHS leadership.

### Interactivity
- Implemented filters for regions, age groups, gender, diagnosis types, and time periods.
- Enabled exploration of disparities and service gaps across multiple dimensions.

## Key Features of the Dashboards

- **Hospital Admissions Inequality:** Visualizes regional and demographic disparities in admission rates and wait times.
- **Dementia Care Insights:** Highlights diagnosis coverage, prescribing patterns, and comorbidity risks by region.
- Supports benchmarking and strategic planning to improve healthcare equity and dementia service delivery.
